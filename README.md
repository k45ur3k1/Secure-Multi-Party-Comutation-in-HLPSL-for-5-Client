# Secure-Multi-Party-Comutation-in-HLPSL-
Secure Multiparty Computation also known as secure computation, Multi-Party Computation (MPC), or privacy-preserving computation has been one of the most active research areas in both theoretical and applied cryptography. There is multifarious importance of such cryptography protocols as they assure security and integrity of communication or storage
The protocol is effective in applications of BCI (Brain-Computer Interface), end-to-end verifiable voting systems, computing machine learning models via linear regression, and many other fields for providing full privacy to end-users while also uplifting the quality of human life. The area of machine learning on encrypted data is booming and is expected to grow significantly hence privacy is becoming a huge concern. 
AVISPA tool is used to analyze large-scale Internet security-sensitive protocols and applications for verifying and testing them. 
The protocol is tested for 2 to 5 clients and is scalable. To retain privacy and also mine data, the concept of partial homomorphic encryption is used.
